# Code Optimization Master

This extension mainly combines the GPTs functionality recently launched by OpenAI, along with my designed [Code Optimization Master GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-UEZYckKpa-cheng-shi-ma-you-hua-da-shi) and the Chrome/Edge extension [ChatGPT Universal Toolbox](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fmijcafgekkphdijpclfgnjhchmiokgp?hl=zh-TW), to help you improve the quality of your code in various aspects, including code structure, execution performance, security, code style, readability, and more technical details you might not have thought of.

There are two requirements for using this package:

1. You must have the [ChatGPT Universal Toolbox](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fmijcafgekkphdijpclfgnjhchmiokgp?hl=zh-TW) extension installed in Chrome or Edge beforehand.

2. You must have a paid [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus) subscription account to use the [Code Optimization Master GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-UEZYckKpa-cheng-shi-ma-you-hua-da-shi) designed for this package.

When used, the default browser window will automatically open, launch the [Code Optimization Master GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-UEZYckKpa-cheng-shi-ma-you-hua-da-shi), and automatically send the **selected range** or **entire document** from the editor to ChatGPT for questioning.

If you have any suggestions or discussions, feel free to leave a message [here](https://github.com/doggy8088/vscode-codeoptimizer/issues).

## Main Features

* Support for adding the **entire document** from the editor to the Code Optimization Master GPT (`codeoptimizer.add_wholefile`)

* Support for adding the **selected range** from the editor to the Code Optimization Master GPT (`codeoptimizer.add_selection`)

* Automatically identify the programming language in the current editor.
